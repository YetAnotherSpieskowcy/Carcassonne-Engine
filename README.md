## Building sources

You can either use the default make target:
```bash
make
```
or run the build command manually:
```bash
go build ./...
```

This will build all Go source files.

## Running the test suite

You can either use the `test` make target:
```bash
make test
```
or run the binary in the **Building sources** section:
```bash
go test ./...
```
